  <h3 align="center">Energetic Storage Reborn</h3>

Energetic Storage Reborn is a plugin that is heavily inspired by the forge mods
named [Applied Energistics 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/applied-energistics-2)
and [Refined Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refined-storage).
If you don't know what Applied Energistics 2 is, it's a mod that allows the player to store large numbers of items,
sometimes hundreds of thousands, in just a few blocks.

Energetic Storage Reborn is a complete recode for Minecraft 1.20.6 of the original [Energetic Storage](https://github.com/SeanOMik/EnergeticStorage).
It is significantly more modern,
designed exclusively for PaperMC, Java 21, Kotlin, and Minecraft 1.20.6+,
utilizing the latest features the game has to offer.
It is also designed to be more efficient and more user-friendly than the original while adding new features
and improvements.
